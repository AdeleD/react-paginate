## Controlled mode (`page`)

When `page` is provided, the component should be absolutely controlled.

It should not be possible to let user clicks change the page (without the controlled state changing from the listening parent component).

See https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate/issues/198#issuecomment-941295225

Add documentation with controlled mode

- show both controlled and uncontrolled in doc ?
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-clock

### `forcePage` prop

Deprecate it and refer to a documentation to implement a controlled component.
